# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# Location.create name:'Beach', city: 'Mallorca', country: 'Spain'
# Location.create name:'Center', city: 'Madrid', country: 'Spain'
# Location.create name:'Learn', city: 'Ironhack', country: 'Spain'
